Description of Project:

This project, for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc., required a new title, as well as a link to the relative path of the css style sheet. I updated image tags to include alternative text for accessibility purposes. Within the CSS style sheet, I added in comments, adjusted font-family, line-height, margins, padding, and floats. I also condensed classes to make document easier to tweak and navigate.
